# QTechTest
The task for using APIs to two things:

first, make a login layout and check the email and password if it is valid or not using retrofit APIs.

second, make products layouts and retrieve all products from the APIs which I saved in recycler view and shown the data about it.

I used retrofit, recyclerView, Validation and finally MVC.

I enjoyed this Test very much and I exercised a little of my talents on it.ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
